Typically with hyper-parameter tuning, we create a model that fits the training data very well, but does not do a great job of generalizing on the test set. This results in a huge performance loss on the testing set. Another reason could be that the test data set is not representative of the training set which would also decrease test performance, but this is much less likely to be the root error compared to training an over-fit model."

In homegeneous ensembles, the same algorithm is used for all base learners on different distributions of the data set (i.e. using different subsets of the data to build a new learner). An example of this would be combining the predictions of three different Random Forest models built on three distinct subsets of the data. On the other hand, heterogeneous ensembles are created using multiple different algorithms as base learners. An example of this is combining the predictions of a Random Forest model, Support Vector Machine model, and XGBoost model on the same data set. Homogeneous uses only one algorithm, heterogeneous considers multiple. "

However, since there are not even five positive fraud cases, the GridSearchCV function would be (a) unable to split the data for the purpose of cross validation, or (b) able to split the data but one of the resulting data sets would have no positive fraud cases.
